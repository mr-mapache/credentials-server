    """
    The 'Secret' protocol is a placeholder for any type representing a secret, such as a password,

    The 'Credentials' protocol outlines the structure for verifying user credentials.
    
    It requires the implementation of the 'verify' method, which will check the validity of a }

    occurs, such as checking against a database or an external service.
